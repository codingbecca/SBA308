# SBA 308
A skills based assessment for Per Scholas.

## Description
A program that takes in CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup objects and a LearnerSubmissions array with the following schemas:
```javascript
const CourseInfo = {
  "id": number,
  "name": string,
}

const AssignmentGroup = {
  "id": number,
  "name": string, // the ID of the course the assignment group belongs to
  "course_id": number, // the percentage weight of the entire assignment group
  "group_weight": number,
  "assignments": [AssignmentInfo],
}


const LearnerSubmissions = [
    "learner_id": number,
    "assignment_id": number,
    "submission": {
      "submitted_at": Date string,
      "score": number
    },
    "learner_id": number,
    "assignment_id": number,
    "submission": {
      "submitted_at": Date string,
      "score": number
    },
]
```
Where the array AssignmentInfo is an array of objects with the following schema:
```javascript
{
  "id": number,
  "name": string,
  // the due date for the assignment
  "due_at": Date string,
  // the maximum points possible for the assignment
  "points_possible": number,
}
```
And outputs an array of objects (one object for each learner) with the following schema:
```javascript
{
    // the ID of the learner for which this data has been collected
    "id": number,
    // the learnerâ€™s total, weighted average, in which assignments
    // with more points_possible should be counted for more
    // e.g. a learner with 50/100 on one assignment and 190/200 on another
    // would have a weighted average score of 240/300 = 80%.
    "avg": number,
    // each assignment should have a key with its ID,
    // and the value associated with it should be the percentage that
    // the learner scored on the assignment (submission.score / points_possible)
    <assignment_id>: number,
    <assignment_id>: number
    // if an assignment is not yet due, it should not be included in either
    // the average or the keyed dictionary of scores
}
```
